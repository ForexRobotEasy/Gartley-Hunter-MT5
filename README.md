# Gartley Hunter MT5 ReadMe File

This ReadMe file provides an overview of the Gartley Hunter MT5 code, which is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 5. The code is an example of a harmonic pattern identifier and alert system, specifically designed to identify and trade the Gartley, Bat, and Butterfly patterns in the financial markets.

## Code Description

The Gartley Hunter MT5 code is written in MQL5 and consists of three main parts:

1. Input Parameters: The code allows the user to enable or disable the identification of specific harmonic patterns, including Bat, Butterfly, and Gartley. By setting the corresponding input parameters to 'true' or 'false,' the user can customize the indicator according to their trading preferences.

2. Custom Indicator Initialization: This part of the code is executed when the indicator is first loaded onto the MetaTrader 5 chart. It includes any necessary initialization code and is responsible for setting up the indicator's initial state.

3. Custom Indicator Iteration: This is the main part of the code where the pattern identification and alert system logic is implemented. It receives the price data (open, high, low, close) and volume information for each iteration and is responsible for identifying the harmonic patterns. The code can be modified to include additional pattern identification algorithms or trading strategies.

4. Custom Indicator Deinitialization: This part of the code is executed when the indicator is removed from the MetaTrader 5 chart. It includes any necessary deinitialization code and is responsible for cleaning up any resources used by the indicator.
